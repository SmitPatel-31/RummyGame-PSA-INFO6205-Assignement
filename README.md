### About:
The Rummy game built using the Monte Carlo method uses probabilistic simulations to predict the best moves throughout the game. Based on various card combinations and player strategies, through a series of simulations, it settles upon the most likely outcomes. Such a strategy enhances decision-making, allowing for more strategic play and a better game experience. The Monte Carlo approach helps evaluate game states and directs the AI into making more smart, planned decisions.
